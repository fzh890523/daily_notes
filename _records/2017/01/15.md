File.RenameTo() is platform dependent and relies on a few conditions to be met in order to succesfully rename a file, a better alternative is using

Path source = currentFile.toPath();
try {
     Files.move(source, source.resolveSibling(formattedName));
} catch (IOException e) {
     e.printStackTrace();
}

From the javadocs:

Many aspects of the behavior of this method are inherently platform-dependent: The rename operation might not be able to move a file from one filesystem to another, it might not be atomic, and it might not succeed if a file with the destination abstract pathname already exists. The return value should always be checked to make sure that the rename operation was successful.
Note that the Files class defines the move method to move or rename a file in a platform independent manner.
```

```
In the Unix'esque O/S's you cannot renameTo() across file systems. This behavior is different than the Unix "mv" command. When crossing file systems mv does a copy and delete which is what you'll have to do if this is the case. 

The same thing would happen on Windows if you tried to renameTo a different drive, i.e. C: -> D:
```

```
The original post requested "an alternative, reliable approach to do a quick move/rename with Java on Windows, either with plain JDK or some external library."

Another option not mentioned yet here is v1.3.2 or later of the apache.commons.io library, which includes FileUtils.moveFile().

It throws an IOException instead of returning boolean false upon error.

## 结论

如上。

样例：
```java
                try{
                    Files.move(metaTmpFile.toPath(), metaFile.toPath(), StandardCopyOption.ATOMIC_MOVE, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
                }catch (Exception e) {
                    LOGGER.error("fail to rename file {} to {}", metaTmpFile, metaFile);
                }
```

# java中lock.lock和try语句块： 最佳实践

ref:
* [stackoverflow - lock.lock() before try(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10868423/lock-lock-before-try)
* [stackoverflow - Java locking structure best pattern](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31058681/java-locking-structure-best-pattern)

```
Assuming that lock is a ReentrantLock, then it makes no real difference, since lock() does not throw any checked exceptions.

The Java documentation, however, leaves lock() outside the try block in the ReentrantLock example. The reason for this is that an unchecked exception in lock() should not lead to unlock() incorrectly being called. Whether correctness is a concern in the presence of an unchecked exception in lock() of all things, that is another discussion altogether.

It is a good coding practice in general to keep things like try blocks as fine-grained as possible.
```

```
The reason is to be found in the javadoc of the .unlock() documentation of Lock:

Implementation Considerations

A Lock implementation will usually impose restrictions on which thread can release a lock (typically only the holder of the lock can release it) and may throw an (unchecked) exception if the restriction is violated. Any restrictions and the exception type must be documented by that Lock implementation.
Similarly, a .lock() may fail with an unchecked exception.

Which means that in:

l.lock();
try {
    ...
} finally {
    l.unlock();
}
if the locking fails, you never get to unlock(). Whereas in:

try {
    l.lock();
    ...
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
you needlessly throw two exceptions if the locking fails; and one of them will be lost.

Not to mention that depending on the implementation of the lock, with the second version you may end up unlocking "someone else"'s lock... Not a good thing.
```


## 结论
要考虑 `lock` 方法抛出的异常，从语义上lock遇到异常时应该是加锁失败，所以不应该执行`unlock`。
所以`lock`要留在try外（之前）。


# java小坑： `Paths.get`拼接path是用的是当前系统的path separator

```java
    public static Path get(String first, String... more) {
        return FileSystems.getDefault().getPath(first, more);
    }
```
如上，而且不能指定，也没找到标准库其他api可以... 
= = 
简单的方式就是replace。

```java
String location = Paths.get(hiveTaskInfo.hdfsPath, sub1.name, sub2.name).toString().replace("\\", "/");  // 蛋疼
```
