<p class="title">And Now For Something Completely Better</p>

<p>
Join Python book author and software
developer <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/index.html">David Beazley</a> for an
experience that will take your Python skills to a new level.
Forget every conception you might have
about a typical training course---these classes are held at Dave's
office in a round-table format that is strictly limited to 6
people. Thus, it's an opportunity to learn with someone who knows
Python inside-out and to interact with other enthusiastic programmers who are just as
excited about Python as you. Plus, there are other ammenities including close
proximity to all of the restaurants and cafes in Chicago's distinctive
Andersonville neighborhood.  You won't be disappointed.</p>

      <p class="title">Python Concurrency and Distributed Computing Workshop</p>

      <p>
      <b>[4 days]</b> Come to Chicago to have your
      brain exploded into tiny bits by the most intense course on Python threads, messaging,
      advanced I/O handling, generators, coroutines, and distributed
      computing around.  Yes, this is the same workshop that 
      spawned the infamous <a href="http://blip.tv/file/2232410">Mindblowing Python
      GIL</a> talk and subsequent <a
      href="http://www.dabeaz.com/GIL">PyCON 2010</a> presentation.
      Topics include threads, thread synchronization, queuing, message passing,
      data serialization, multiprocessing, event-driven I/O, generators,
      coroutines, actors, remote procedure call, distributed objects, and
      more.  A major focus of this workshop is on the underlying principles
      that form the foundation of creating reliable systems--you will walk
      away with new insight and ideas for improving your own code.
      Past participants have described the workshop as containing about the same
      amount of material as three semesters of a computer science degree, only
      better.

	<b>[5 days]</b> The ultimate project course for serious

       take a compilers course in school or if you simply want to know
       how magical things like PyPy or Numba work under the covers, then this is the course
       for you.   Covers just about everything that would be covered
       in an introductory level university compilers course including regular expressions, lexing,
       parsers and parser generators, abstract syntax trees, type
       systems, control flow graphs, code generation, and simple
       optimization.  A major aspect of this course concerns the software
       engineering, design, and testing issues of writing a compiler.
       More than 90% of the time is spend coding.

	  learn what really makes Python tick.  The course starts out by
	  looking at subtle aspects of the Python code you are already writing, but then
	  dives into a wide variety of advanced topics 
	  including the object model, data encapsulation, descriptors,
	  generators, coroutines, context managers, decorators, metaclasses,

	  a wide range practical programming problems.

</a><p><a name="about">
Classes are taught by David Beazley, author of the 
 </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-Developers-Library/dp/0672329786">Python
Essential Reference, 4th Edition</a> (Addison Wesley) and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027072.do">Python Cookbook, 3rd Edition</a> (O'Reilly Media). David has been actively involved with the Python
community since 1996 and is the guilty party responsible for
<a href="http://www.swig.org/">Swig</a>, a compiler for integrating
Python with C/C++.  From 1990-1997, he worked at Los Alamos National
Laboratory where he was one of the early pioneers of using Python with scientific software.
From 1998-2005, he was an assistant professor
in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago
where he taught courses in operating systems, networks, and compilers.
Dave has previously taught tutorials at PyCON, OSCON, USENIX
LISA, and the USENIX Technical Conference.  He currently

<p class="title">What Are Classes Like?</p>

<p>
All classes are <b>strictly limited to 6 students</b>--a size that
makes it easier to interact with others and have meaningful discussions.
Typically, everyone meets for breakfast and coffee around
9:00am. The course then runs from 9:30am-5:30pm with lunch and an afternoon
coffee break.  In most courses, more than half of the time is spent
programming and using Python.  Come ready to code.</p>

<p>
Although you can certainly learn Python from a book or online tutorial, a class gives you a unique
opportunity to meet other programmers, make connections with the larger
Python community, find out about bleeding-edge topics, and to walk
away with all sorts of new ideas.</p>

<p>
All courses are conducted according to the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct">Python Community Code of
Conduct</a>.
