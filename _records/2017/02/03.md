赋值用atomic是因为这个么
18:36:34
M 2017/2/3 18:36:34
主要是为了可见性

相反吧。 这段说的是在32位机器上实现64bit的atomic是比较困难的。
M 2017/2/3 18:36:41
不同goroutine的

但这个跟应用开发者关系不太大。
M 2017/2/3 18:37:00
脏读在64下，比较少见
M 2017/2/3 18:37:02
和cpu有关

部分32bit CPU提供了64bit的CAS指令。除此之外，mutex吧... = =
M 2017/2/3 18:39:57
32bit 也可以的
M 2017/2/3 18:40:02
用CPU lock 指令
M 2017/2/3 18:40:12
LOCK 可以锁定总线
M 2017/2/3 18:40:41
新架构的CPU ，可以用MESI 协议不锁总线
18:42:06

额一个是cacheline失效一个是mem write back
M 2017/2/3 18:42:56
然后在编译时候代码加上 barrier
M 2017/2/3 18:43:04
这是nginx 32bit CPU 自增的做法

看了下发的链接。
lock prefix指令的目的是防止指令重排，这是atomic操作的必要条件而不是充分条件。无论是锁总线还是缓存失效，都要求在一个指令内完成atomic操作。 这个要求cpu本身提供一个指令内操作64bit的指令。在x86上是CMPXCH8B。

  适用lock指令前缀.虽然可以达到一个原子上的操作，但是这个机制操作的范围小。
  也就是说它是指令集的同步保护机制。可以达到64位的内存单元.

  x86 处理器使用“lock”前缀的方式提供了在指令执行期间对总线加锁的手段。
  芯片上有一条引线 LOCK，如果在一条汇编指令(ADD, ADC, AND, BTC, BTR, BTS, CMPXCHG, CMPXCH8B, DEC, INC, NEG, NOT, OR, SBB, SUB, XOR,XADD, XCHG)前加上"lock"前缀，经过汇编后的机器代码就使得处理器执行该指令时把引线 LOCK 的电位拉低，从而把总线锁住，这样其它处理器或使用DMA的外设暂时无法通过同一总线访问内存

  从 P6 处理器开始，如果指令访问的内存区域已经存在于处理器的内部缓存中，则“lock” 前缀并不将引线 LOCK 的电位拉低，而是锁住本处理器的内部缓存，然后依靠缓存一致性协议保证操作的原子性.

* [64 bit atomic in 32 bit machine](https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/26068/)

  ```
  In the particular case that this 32 bit machine has a Pentium or higher x86 CPU, the CPU provides a 64-bit atomic compare-and-exchange operation CMPXCHG8B. The PAE kernel uses this instruction, see src/sys/i386/include/pmap.h and look for atomic_cmpset_64. This operation is however not generally available. (FreeBSD wants to support 32-bit architectures that do not have such an operation.)

  It appears to work to use GCC's __sync_bool_compare_and_swap builtin function with 64-bit operands, provided an appropriate -march= option is given (by default, FreeBSD's GCC will generate code that will run on a 486 and thus cannot use CMPXCHG8B).
  ```

* [Memory barrier - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier)

  ```
  Memory barriers are low-level primitives and part of an architecture's memory model, which, like instruction sets, vary considerably between architectures, so it is not appropriate to generalize about memory barrier behavior. The conventional wisdom is that using memory barriers correctly requires careful study of the architecture manuals for the hardware being programmed. That said, the following paragraph offers a glimpse of some memory barriers which exist in contemporary products.

  Some architectures, including the ubiquitous x86/x64, provide several memory barrier instructions including an instruction sometimes called "full fence". A full fence ensures that all load and store operations prior to the fence will have been committed prior to any loads and stores issued following the fence. Other architectures, such as the Itanium, provide separate "acquire" and "release" memory barriers which address the visibility of read-after-write operations from the point of view of a reader (sink) or writer (source) respectively. Some architectures provide separate memory barriers to control ordering between different combinations of system memory and I/O memory. When more than one memory barrier instruction is available it is important to consider that the cost of different instructions may vary considerably.
  ```

* [[Are memory barriers necessary for atomic reference counting shared immutable data? - stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2599238/are-memory-barriers-necessary-for-atomic-reference-counting-shared-immutable-dat)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2599238/are-memory-barriers-necessary-for-atomic-reference-counting-shared-immutable-dat)

  ```
  On x86, it will turn into a lock prefixed assembly instruction, like LOCK XADD.
  Being a single instruction, it is non-interruptible. As an added "feauture", the lock prefix results in a full memory barrier:

  "...locked operations serialize all outstanding load and store operations (that is, wait for them to complete)." ..."Locked operations are atomic with respect to all other memory operations and all externally visible events. Only instruction fetch and page table accesses can pass locked instructions. Locked instructions can be used to synchronize data written by one processor and read by another processor." - Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Chapter 8.1.2.
  A memory barrier is in fact implemented as a dummy LOCK OR or LOCK AND in both the .NET and the JAVA JIT on x86/x64.
  So you have a full fence on x86 as an added bonus, whether you like it or not. :)

  On PPC, it is different. An LL/SC pair - lwarx & stwcx - with a subtraction inside can be used to load the memory operand into a register, subtract one, then either write it back if there was no other store to the target location, or retry the whole loop if there was. An LL/SC can be interrupted.
  It also does not mean an automatic full fence.
  This does not however compromise the atomicity of the counter in any way.
  It just means that in the x86 case, you happen to get a fence as well, "for free".
  On PPC, one can insert a full fence by emitting a (lw)sync instruction.

  All in all, explicit memory barriers are not necessary for the atomic counter to work properly.
