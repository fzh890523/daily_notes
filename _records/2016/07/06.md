```shell
root@pd-hadoop-02:/opt/servers/apache-flume-1.6.0-bin # ls /tmp/t/
1  2  3
root@pd-hadoop-02:/opt/servers/apache-flume-1.6.0-bin # ls /tmp/t/ | cat -A
1$
2$
3$

root@pd-hadoop-02:/opt/servers/apache-flume-1.6.0-bin # ls /tmp/t/ | xargs 'ls -l' '{}'
xargs: ls -l: No such file or directory
root@pd-hadoop-02:/opt/servers/apache-flume-1.6.0-bin # ls /tmp/t/ | xargs -t ls -l '{}'  
ls -l {} 1 2 3
ls: cannot access {}: No such file or directory

ls -l /tmp/t/3

```

可以看到：
* -i 使得 '{}' 进行替换
* -t 使得会print每条实际执行的命令
* command之前的option传给xargs，之后的传给command
* 注意ls的返回不包括dir，需要自己拼

# find查指定大小（上下）的文件
如： `find . -type f -name "*.txt" +0c` - 查当前目录内不为空的txt文件

```
Use:

find . -type f -size +4096c
to find files bigger than 4096 bytes.

And :

find . -type f -size -4096c
to find files smaller than 4096 bytes.

Notice the + and - difference after the size switch.

The -size switch explained:

-size n[cwbkMG]

    File uses n units of space. The following suffixes can be used:

    `b'    for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix  is
                                used)

    `c'    for bytes

    `w'    for two-byte words

    `k'    for Kilobytes       (units of 1024 bytes)

    `M'    for Megabytes    (units of 1048576 bytes)

    `G'    for Gigabytes (units of 1073741824 bytes)

    The size does not count indirect blocks, but it does count
    blocks in sparse files that are not actually allocated. Bear in
    mind that the `%k' and `%b' format specifiers of -printf handle
    sparse files differently. The `b' suffix always denotes
    512-byte blocks and never 1 Kilobyte blocks, which is different
    to the behaviour of -ls.

# golang中的相等“equality”判断
```
The equality operators == and != apply to operands that are comparable. The ordering operators <, <=, >, and >= apply to operands that are ordered. These terms and the result of the comparisons are defined as follows:

Boolean values are comparable. Two boolean values are equal if they are either both true or both false.
Integer values are comparable and ordered, in the usual way.
Floating point values are comparable and ordered, as defined by the IEEE-754 standard.
Complex values are comparable. Two complex values u and v are equal if both real(u) == real(v) and imag(u) == imag(v).
String values are comparable and ordered, lexically byte-wise.
Pointer values are comparable. Two pointer values are equal if they point to the same variable or if both have value nil. Pointers to distinct zero-size variables may or may not be equal.
Channel values are comparable. Two channel values are equal if they were created by the same call to make or if both have value nil.
Interface values are comparable. Two interface values are equal if they have identical dynamic types and equal dynamic values or if both have value nil.
A value x of non-interface type X and a value t of interface type T are comparable when values of type X are comparable and X implements T. They are equal if t's dynamic type is identical to X and t's dynamic value is equal to x.
Struct values are comparable if all their fields are comparable. Two struct values are equal if their corresponding non-blank fields are equal.
Array values are comparable if values of the array element type are comparable. Two array values are equal if their corresponding elements are equal.
A comparison of two interface values with identical dynamic types causes a run-time panic if values of that type are not comparable. This behavior applies not only to direct interface value comparisons but also when comparing arrays of interface values or structs with interface-valued fields.

Slice, map, and function values are not comparable. However, as a special case, a slice, map, or function value may be compared to the predeclared identifier nil. Comparison of pointer, channel, and interface values to nil is also allowed and follows from the general rules above.
```
从上文可知： **指针** 的`相等`只看是否指向同一个值，也即只比较`地址`。
