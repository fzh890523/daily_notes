# 黑莓priv耗电问题

1. 非常耗电，一直耗电，充电速度略小于耗电速度
> 干掉谷歌全家桶以后，基本好转
2. 间发式耗电，比较耗电，6:30-12:30就没电了，只有不到2个小时的较重度使用（微信读书+网易云音乐）
> 查到 `ANT HAL Service` 耗电20+%
3. 仔细看了下，好像是安卓系统的耗电（如20.1%）算在了每个子服务上，也即每个子服务都写着20.1%。 应该是个误会
4. ss自启动，全程ss然后放开大陆IP，似乎可以了

## ANT HAL Service介绍
```
This service is similar to the system components that enable other forms of wireless connectivity on your phone (ie. WiFi, NFC) and will not run or use system resources unless you start an app that requires ANT wireless communication. It is pre-installed by your device manufacturer to allow the built-in ANT wireless hardware already present in your mobile device to operate. If you do not intend to use this feature there will be no impact to your system and no further action is required.
If this service is not pre-installed on your phone you may still be able to enable ANT+ communication, see http://www.thisisant.com/developer/ant/ant-in-android/ for more info.

What is ANT?

ANT is an extremely power efficient wireless communication technology. ANT allows you to connect to, and make use of various other ANT or ANT+ devices. Today, this service allows you to connect to popular interoperable ANT+ sport/fitness/health devices such as heart rate sensors, fitness equipment, cycling products, weight scales and more. In the future it will be possible to use ANT to enable a myriad of new applications from your mobile device, such as home automation control of lighting, temperature and door lock functions. Visit www.thisisant.com for more info.

How to use:

This system service cannot be launched directly. It will run automatically in the background whenever any application that requires ANT wireless communication is used. 
ANT+ enabled applications also typically require downloading the ANT+ Plugins http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dsi.ant.plugins.antplus

Some popular apps enhanced with ANT+:
* Samsung S Health
* Garmin Fit™
* SportsTracker by STL
* Endomondo
* My Tracks
* Run.GPS Trainer UV
* IpBike, IpWatts, IpPeloton, IpSmartHr
* Selfloops
* SportyPal
* MapMyFITNESS/RIDE/RUN/WALK+/HIKE/DOGWALK


Developing ANT Applications:

ANT is an ultra low power wireless technology great for low data rate applications such as sensors, monitors, beacons, command and control, etc. Connecting devices and transferring data is simple using our ANT API. Developing apps for ANT+ devices is even easier using our ANT+ Plugins API. These APIs are free to use. More information is available at http://www.thisisant.com/developer/ant/ant-in-android/.


Required Android Permissions:

Full Network Access: The ANT Radio Service will never download or upload any data over the internet. This permission is only required because it is possible to install the ANT Radio Service on an Android Emulator (ie: for development purposes) in which case it requires access to internet sockets to communicate with an ANT USB Stick on the host Windows PC using the ANT Android Emulator Tools. This communication requires the INTERNET permission but only communicates with the local PC.

Modify System Settings: This allows initialization of whether ANT should be turned off or kept on when Airplane mode is entered.

Bluetooth Admin: On some hardware configurations ANT may require communicating with Bluetooth at the system level. However, this service will not start bluetooth scans or create bluetooth connections.

# shell获取stderr
> 背景： `python -V`对于python2会输出到stderr而对于python3会输出到stdout

```shell
if [[ `python -V 2>&1` =~ ".* 2\..*" ]]; then do_sth; fi
# 或者
if [[ $(python -V 2>&1) =~ ".* 2\..*" ]]; then do_sth; fi
# 或者
if [[ `$({ python -V | cat -A; } 2>&1) ` =~ ".* 2\..*" ]]; then do_sth; fi
# 这种方式能扩展到更多（管道连接的）命令，不过注意： {}之间的命令头尾的空格是必须的
```

> 注意： zsh支持上面正则的""，但bash似乎不支持，需要写成 `if [[ $(python -V 2>&1) =~ .*\ 2\..* ]]; then do_sth; fi`

# windows msys2搞定google pass

1. install expect
```shell
pacman -Ssq ".*expect.*"
pacman -S expect
```
