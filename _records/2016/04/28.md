# 非常深的目录的操作问题（删除等）

```shell
while true
do
  mkdir Folder1
  cd Folder1
done
```

```shell
# untested code, didn't bother actually testing since the OP already solved the problem.

while [ -d Folder1 ]; do
    mv Folder1/Folder1/Folder1/Folder1  tmp # repeat more times to work in larger batches
    rm -r Folder1     # remove the first several levels remaining after moving the main tree out
    # then repeat to end up with the remaining big tree under the original name
    mv tmp/Folder1/Folder1/.../Folder1 Folder1
    rm -r tmp
done
```

输出如下：
```shell

额，也许是新版本的命令对这种超长path做了支持，囧... （几百层的毫无压力）


# 任意数量任务（sum）“尽量平均”的分配给任意个worker（workers）
**前提**
1. sum > workers
2. workers > 1

## 分析
**尽量平均**的最理想情况是任何两个worker处理的任务数之差小于等于1，也即 **|t<sub>wx</sub> - t<sub>wy</sub>| <= 1**

## 推理
1. m + n = workers
  a\*m + b\*n = sum
2. (b+1)\*m + b\*n = sum -> b\*(m+n) + m = sum -> b\*workers + m = sum
3. 因为m∈[0,workers]，所以也即 [b,b+1]\*workers = sum
4. b = (sum - 1) / workers （前提： **1 < workers**，否则就成了 (sum - workers)/workers = sum/workers - 1）
5. m = sum - b\*workers = (sum - 1) / workers \* workers （注意：**这里不能消除**）
6. n = sum - m = sum - (sum - 1) / workers \* workers
7. a = b + 1 = (sum - 1) / workers + 1

## 公式
见上面推理结果

给 **(sum-1)/workers\*workers** 个worker分别 **(sum-1)/workers+1** 个任务；
给 **sum-(sum-1)/workers\*workers** 个worker分别 **(sum-1)/workers** 个任务

> 此公式仅不适用于 workers == 1的情况，对于sum <= workers 仍然适用


# mysql latency 请求耗时
```
It's because if the DB is not on the same server as the frontend you have to do a round trip for each query (potentially more, depending on the size of the answer). It can easily take up to 1 ms to ping another server in the same datacenter. Much less if the two servers are on the same rack, but 1 ms is a good rule of thumb.

That means that for ~300 small queries you should expect ~300ms, pretty close to what you are seeing.

If the two servers are on the same machine, you only have to do some context switches between processes to move the data from the DB process to the frontend. Usually a context switch (with all the typical flushes) take ~40us (very broadly speaking), and you need at least a couple of them (frontend asks for data, DB reads requests and prepares and serves the data, and frontend reads back the data). So I would expect ~80us for each query (let's round it to 0.1ms to make the math easier). You can thus expect ~30ms for 300 small queries, which is also pretty close to what you are seeing.

[MySQL Query Latency with the DTrace pid Provider](http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2011/03/14/mysql-query-latency-with-the-dtrace-pid-provider/) 里提到了可以用DTrace工具来查看mysql latency数据


# redis latency 请求耗时
[redis benchmarks](http://redis.io/topics/benchmarks) 里提到，可以用
redis-cli --latency 来查看redis耗时数据。

```
The redis-cli --latency -h -p command is a tool that helps troubleshoot and understand latency problems you maybe experiencing with Redis. It does so by measuring the time for the Redis server to respond to the Redis PING command in milliseconds.

In this context latency is the maximum delay between the time a client issues a command and the time the reply to the command is received by the client. Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond range, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.
-- Redis latency problems troubleshooting

So when we ran the command redis-cli --latency -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 Redis enters into a special mode in which it continuously samples latency (by running PING).

Now let's breakdown that data it returns: min: 0, max: 15, avg: 0.12 (2839 samples)

What's (2839 samples)? This is the amount of times the redis-cli recorded issuing the PING command and receiving a response. In other words, this is your sample data. In our example we recorded 2839 requests and responses.

What's min: 0? The min value represents the minimum delay between the time the CLI issued PING and the time the reply was received. In other words, this was the absolute best response time from our sampled data.

What's max: 15? The max value is the opposite of min. It represents the maximum delay between the time the CLI issued PING and the time the reply to the command was received. This is the longest response time from our sampled data. In our example of 2839 samples, the longest transaction took 15ms.

What's avg: 0.12? The avg value is the average response time in milliseconds for all our sampled data. So on average, from our 2839 samples the response time took 0.12ms.

Basically, higher numbers for min, max, and avg is a bad thing.
```

BB测试服务器到本机虚拟机里的redis-server的latency数据如下。 考虑到1ms左右的网络传输耗时，redis本身的latency应该在几百us-ms的级别。

实测测试环境和线上大约都在20ms左右，好像有点高。 哎...
