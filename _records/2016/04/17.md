## 方法一： 通过命令修改终端属性

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void){
  int c;
  /* use system call to make terminal send all keystrokes directly to stdin */
  system ("/bin/stty raw");
  while((c=getchar())!= '.') {
    /* type a period to break out of the loop, since CTRL-D won't work raw */
    putchar(c);
  }
  /* use system call to set terminal behaviour to more normal behaviour */
  system ("/bin/stty cooked");
  return 0;
}
```

## 通过库函数修改终端属性

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include <termios.h>            //termios, TCSANOW, ECHO, ICANON
#include <unistd.h>     //STDIN_FILENO


int main(void){   
    int c;   
    static struct termios oldt, newt;

    /*tcgetattr gets the parameters of the current terminal
    STDIN_FILENO will tell tcgetattr that it should write the settings
    of stdin to oldt*/
    tcgetattr( STDIN_FILENO, &oldt);
    /*now the settings will be copied*/
    newt = oldt;

    /*ICANON normally takes care that one line at a time will be processed
    that means it will return if it sees a "\n" or an EOF or an EOL*/
    newt.c_lflag &= ~(ICANON);          

    /*Those new settings will be set to STDIN
    TCSANOW tells tcsetattr to change attributes immediately. */
    tcsetattr( STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &newt);

    /*This is your part:
    I choose 'e' to end input. Notice that EOF is also turned off
    in the non-canonical mode*/
    while((c=getchar())!= 'e')      
        putchar(c);                 

    /*restore the old settings*/
    tcsetattr( STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &oldt);


    return 0;
}

/*
You will notice, that every character appears twice. This is because the input is immediately echoed back to the terminal and then your program puts it back with putchar() too. If you want to disassociate the input from the output, you also have to turn of the ECHO flag. You can do this by simply changing the appropriate line to:

newt.c_lflag &= ~(ICANON | ECHO);

```
ERRNO(3)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 ERRNO(3)
NAME         top

       errno - number of last error
SYNOPSIS         top

       #include <errno.h>
DESCRIPTION         top

       The <errno.h> header file defines the integer variable errno, which
       is set by system calls and some library functions in the event of an
       error to indicate what went wrong.  Its value is significant only
       when the return value of the call indicated an error (i.e., -1 from
       most system calls; -1 or NULL from most library functions); a
       function that succeeds is allowed to change errno.

       Valid error numbers are all nonzero; errno is never set to zero by
       any system call or library function.

       For some system calls and library functions (e.g., getpriority(2)),
       -1 is a valid return on success.  In such cases, a successful return
       can be distinguished from an error return by setting errno to zero
       before the call, and then, if the call returns a status that
       indicates that an error may have occurred, checking to see if errno
       has a nonzero value.

       errno is defined by the ISO C standard to be a modifiable lvalue of
       type int, and must not be explicitly declared; errno may be a macro.
       errno is thread-local; setting it in one thread does not affect its
       value in any other thread.

       All the error names specified by POSIX.1 must have distinct values,
       with the exception of EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK, which may be the same.

       Below is a list of the symbolic error names that are defined on
       Linux.  Some of these are marked POSIX.1, indicating that the name is
       defined by POSIX.1-2001, or C99, indicating that the name is defined
       by C99.

NOTES         top

       A common mistake is to do

           if (somecall() == -1) {
               printf("somecall() failed\n");
               if (errno == ...) { ... }
           }

       where errno no longer needs to have the value it had upon return from
       somecall() (i.e., it may have been changed by the printf(3)).  If the
       value of errno should be preserved across a library call, it must be
       saved:

           if (somecall() == -1) {
               int errsv = errno;
               printf("somecall() failed\n");
               if (errsv == ...) { ... }
           }

       It was common in traditional C to declare errno manually (i.e.,
       extern int errno) instead of including <errno.h>.  Do not do this.
       It will not work with modern versions of the C library.  However, on
       (very) old UNIX systems, there may be no <errno.h> and the
       declaration is needed.
