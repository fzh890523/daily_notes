You can override the key binding and manually set it to the command you want to run:

Open the Key Binding Resolver (Ctrl + Shift + P, Resolver).
Press your key binding in question (Ctrl + Shift + A).
The Resolver will show all the commands and the selectors (looks like a CSS selector) associated with that key binding. The one that took precedence is highlighted, and the ones that are ignored are not highlighted. Make a note of the highlighted selector.
Go to the Settings > Key bindings screen.
Search for the selector and click the clipboard button in the leftmost column of its row.
Open your keymap.cson (Ctrl + Shift + P, Open keymap).
Paste the selector.
Override the command associated with that selector. Using the most specific selector from your screenshot as an example, this will make the Ctrl + Shift + A key binding run the git-plus:add command:

'.platform-win32 atom-workspace, .platform-win32 atom-workspace atom-text-editor, .platform-linux atom-workspace, .platform-linux atom-workspace atom-text-editor':
  'ctrl-shift-A': 'git-plus:add'

Alternatively, you can use a package such as disable-keybindings or keymap-disabler to disable key bindings on a per package basis: https://discuss.atom.io/t/disable-default-keybindings/1077/36.
