You can override the key binding and manually set it to the command you want to run:

Open the Key Binding Resolver (Ctrl + Shift + P, Resolver).
Press your key binding in question (Ctrl + Shift + A).
The Resolver will show all the commands and the selectors (looks like a CSS selector) associated with that key binding. The one that took precedence is highlighted, and the ones that are ignored are not highlighted. Make a note of the highlighted selector.
Go to the Settings > Key bindings screen.
Search for the selector and click the clipboard button in the leftmost column of its row.
Open your keymap.cson (Ctrl + Shift + P, Open keymap).
Paste the selector.
Override the command associated with that selector. Using the most specific selector from your screenshot as an example, this will make the Ctrl + Shift + A key binding run the git-plus:add command:

'.platform-win32 atom-workspace, .platform-win32 atom-workspace atom-text-editor, .platform-linux atom-workspace, .platform-linux atom-workspace atom-text-editor':
  'ctrl-shift-A': 'git-plus:add'

Alternatively, you can use a package such as disable-keybindings or keymap-disabler to disable key bindings on a per package basis: https://discuss.atom.io/t/disable-default-keybindings/1077/36.

# wpa_supplicant禁止自动连接wifi
/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf 设置 disabled=1


# wpa_supplicant多无线网+静态地址配置
```shell
Edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and add id_str="school" under the schools wpa info and id_str="home" under your homes wpa info. Your file should now look similar to this:

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="SCHOOLS NETWORK NAME"
    psk="SCHOOLS PASSWORD"
    id_str="school"
}

network={
    ssid="HOME NETWORK NAME"
    psk="HOME PASSWORD"
    id_str="home"
}
Then set up /etc/network/interfaces with iface school inet static and iface home inet static in it so it looks like the following:

auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

iface school inet static
address <school address>
gateway <school gateway>
netmask <school netmask>

iface home inet static
address <home address>
gateway <home gateway>
netmask <home netmask>
```
