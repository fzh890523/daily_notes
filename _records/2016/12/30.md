Hive Client Tools : Tools for query
Hive evolving as the simplest way to access the structured data from hadoop ecosystem, analysts often need a simpler interface to run queries and view results. Thankfully there are many FREE tools available to do so. Following are a list of tools that are free but not the entire list. I am not rating these tools either as there is always a possibility of a better one available somewhere that I am not aware of.

Hive Client Library: [Command Line]
This is a non-ui tool i.e. a command line interface and provides all the features that you need in hive environment. Just do a ssh to your cluster and hive command "hive" to start the hive shell.

Beeline: [Command Line]
This is based on SQLLine lib. Given the hive driver is class path and a JDBC URL, it can connect to hiveserver2 and run queries.

beeline> !connect jdbc:hive2://<host>:<port>/<db>;auth=noSasl hiveuser pass org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver

Hue: [Web Interface]
Hue has gotten really interesting over time. To get a feel of hue, head to the hue demo site.
Hortonworks sandbox comes preinstalled with Hue (though a good old version which can be updated) and runs on port 8000. like http://sandbox.hortoworks.com:8000/

Oracle SQL Developer: [Java Application]
Note: This only works with cloudier driver and with a  specific version. It does not appear that there is long term support to make it work with newer versions. If interested you can refer to this blog about how to setup the environment.

IBM Data Studio: [Java Application]
Built on top of Eclipse, I liked this tool for a short period that I worked with it. If interested to use, please head here

Squirrel: [Java Application]
This is one SQL Editor which supports almost all databases in market that supports JDBC.  Getting to work with Hive needs some amount of effort, buts its worth it considering Squirrel is written in Java and runs on Windows/Mac/Linux. For installation and configuration, I have posted some details here

Aginity Hadoop Workbench: [Windows Application]
This is windows native built application and my favorite. It does not provide connectivity to PIG, Oozie, etc like hue does. But for writing and running queries, it really excels. Aginity workbench also comes with a File shell that can help in managing files on HDFS. Its free, though registration is required. http://www.aginity.com/workbench/hadoop/
