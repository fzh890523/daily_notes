The OpenCV docs for imread state that by default for 3-channel color images the data is stored in BGR order, e.g. in your Mat, the data is stored as a 1D unsigned char pointer, such that any given color pixel at index px_idx is 3 elements in order, with [px_idx + 0]: blue channel, [px_idx + 1]: green channel, [px_idx + 2]: red channel

Note In the case of color images, the decoded images will have the channels stored in B G R order.
You have some (limited) control over the color type via the flag parameter you pass to imread, although you can't specify the channel ordering (you should assume all color images will be BGR)

CV_LOAD_IMAGE_ANYDEPTH - If set, return 16-bit/32-bit image when the input has the corresponding depth, otherwise convert it to 8-bit.

CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR - If set, always convert image to the color one

CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE - If set, always convert image to the grayscale one
Or more simply,

>0 Return a 3-channel color image. (same as CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR)

=0 Return a grayscale image. (same as CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE)

<0 Return the loaded image as is (with alpha channel). (same as CV_LOAD_IMAGE_ANYDEPTH)
```

可以看到，默认为BGR，并且不能指定，也即可以认为都是BGR，除非显式转换。
（python cv似乎修改了这个默认行为）
