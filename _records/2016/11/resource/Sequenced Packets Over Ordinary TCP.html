<h1>Sequenced Packets Over Ordinary TCP</h1>

<p>This is a rough idea for an admittedly not hugely useful technical 
hack related to low-level network protocol gubbins. If you don't want to 
know about this, look away now.</p>

<p>I will assume you know what <a
href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt">TCP</a> is (oh - i'll
warn you now that i say 'packet' instead of 'segment' throughout this
document; i'm like that). I will assume you know what the <a
href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xns/syssocket.h.html">POSIX
socket API</a> almost universally used to access it is. What you may or
may not know about are the two things i'm going to talk about today: the
sequenced packet (aka SOCK_SEQPACKET) socket type from the socket API
and the urgent pointer from the TCP specification.</p>

<p>The socket API supports sockets of several types; 'type' does not
refer to the protocol behind the socket, but rather to the semantics
associated with the socket. The best-known socket types are stream
(SOCK_STREAM) and datagram (SOCK_DGRAM); the former supplies a pair of
full-duplex, reliable, ordered, structureless byte streams connected to
a single remote socket, while the latter supplies an aperture through
which unreliable, unordered, smallish bundles of bytes can be sent to
multiple remote sockets. There are, however, other socket types; the 
most interesting is the sequenced-packet socket (SOCK_SEQPACKET). The <a 
href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/xsh_chap02_10.html">actual 
text</a> of the socket API specification says of sequenced packet 
sockets:</p>

<blockquote>The SOCK_SEQPACKET socket type is similar to the SOCK_STREAM
type, and is also connection-oriented. The only difference between these
types is that record boundaries are maintained using the SOCK_SEQPACKET
type. A record can be sent using one or more output operations and
received using one or more input operations, but a single operation
never transfers parts of more than one record. Record boundaries are
visible to the receiver via the MSG_EOR flag in the received message
flags returned by the recvmsg() function. It is protocol-specific
whether a maximum record size is imposed.</blockquote>

<p>So basically, it's either a sequence of packets which are delivered
reliably and in order, or a reliable, ordered stream with record
boundaries in it, depending on how you look at it. Either way, it's
clearly halfway between stream (ie TCP) and datagram (ie UDP) sockets.
The stuff about MSG_EOR is how you mark the ends of messages; messages
are read and written like stream data, but with a couple of nuances: to
mark the end of a message when sending, set the MSG_EOR flag in the last
send(), and to detect the end of a message when receiving, use recvmsg()
and look for the MSG_EOR flag in the msghdr.msg_flags field.</p>

<p>(Incidentally, that line saying "a record can be sent using one or
more output operations and received using one or more input operations"
is a bit weird; the specs for recv() and recvmsg() say "for
message-based sockets such as SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire
message must be read in a single operation.". There's a <a
href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/mailarchives/austin-review-l/msg00839.html">post
on an Open Group mailing list</a> on the semantics of the MSG_WAITALL
flag in the context of sequenced packet sockets which indicates that
messages on a sequenced packet socket can indeed be delivered through
multiple recv() calls, which does make more sense; you can then use
MSG_WAITALL to force delivery in a single read, although it doesn't work
if the message is bigger than your buffer)</p>

<p>Moreover, sequenced packet sockets are probably the most
programmer-friendly kind: they have strong reliability and ordering
guarantees (like TCP but unlike UDP), and they provide record
demarcation at the protocol level (like UDP but unlike TCP); they should
therefore be a key tool for network programmers. However, as far as i
can tell, there is no internet transport-layer protocol in common use
which has sequenced packet semantics; SOCK_SEQPACKET is therefore not a
generally available socket type! Where it does turn up is when you're
running connections straight over ATM or IR or other suitable link
layers, and nobody cares about that.</p>

<p>But all is not lost! I have come up with a way to supply sequenced
packet semantics using entirely normal TCP, by exploiting a little-used
but historically ancient feature of that protocol which, i think, was
designed expressely for that purpose: the urgent pointer.</p>

<p>The TCP spec is pretty brief, so have a read through and see what it
says about the the urgent pointer. Basically, it's a facility by which
one end of a TCP connection can indicate to the other that there's
urgent data somewhere in the stream. From the client (ie
application-layer protocol) point of view, it looks like there's a
button next to the output stream of each socket, with a red light next
to the input stream of the other, both labelled 'URGENT!!!'; one end
writes some data that it thinks is urgent, then hits the button: the
light at the other end then goes on immediately, and goes off once the
client has read all the data that the sender had written before hitting
the button. The TCP modules handle this by dint of two components of
their packets: the 'urgent pointer field significant' (aka URG) control
bit, and the urgent pointer (UP). The URG bit is set in all packets sent
after the button is pressed, up to and including the one containing the
last byte of urgent data; the presence of a set URG bit in a packet
therefore indicates to the receiving TCP module that it should switch on
the urgency light. The UP points to the last byte of the urgent data
(RFC 793 is confused about this - see <a
href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt">RFC 1122</a>, section
4.2.2.4, for the correction); the receiving module can turn off the
urgency light once the client has read that byte.</p>

<p>For completeness, i should point out that the UP field in the TCP
header is actually only 16 bits long; it expresses the UP as an offset
from the sequence number of the packet. RFC 793 is cagey about what
happens when the UP is more than 65535 greater than the current sequence
number, but <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2147.txt"a>RFC
2147</a> says, inter alia:</p>

<blockquote>When a TCP packet is to be sent with an Urgent Pointer
(i.e., the URG bit set), first calculate the offset from the Sequence
Number to the Urgent Pointer. If the offset is less than 65535, fill in
the Urgent field and continue with the normal TCP processing. If the
offset is greater than 65535, and the offset is greater than or equal to
the length of the TCP data [which it will be, unless you're dealing with
super-jumbograms], fill in the Urgent Pointer with 65535 and continue
with the normal TCP processing.</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, i propose abusing the urgent mechanism to mark the ends of
messages: the urgent pointer simply points to the end of the current
message. Rather than connecting this to buttons and lights, the
seqpacket-aware TCP module does the right thing with MSG_EOR: MSG_EOR
being set in send() causes the UP to be set, and hitting the UP when
doing recvmsg() causes it to set MSG_EOR. Simple!</p>

<p>There is one little problem, which is that you can't pack multiple
messages into a single TCP packet, since you wouldn't be able to have
the UP pointing at the ends of all of them. This is a shame, but not
that big a deal; the whole sequenced packet thing is about reasonably
big packets. If a burning need for multiple messages per packets was
felt, w e could specify a negotiable TCP option to hold additional
message-end pointers.</p>

<p>There is some degree of interaction between the mechanism i describe
and TCP's push function. The push function was specified in part so that
applications can indicate to the TCP module when they'd got to the end
of a block of data, so that it does not waste time waiting for more;
with explicit message boundaries, it can work this out itself. TCP
modules should send less-than-MTU packets when and only when a message
end is signalled; the rest of the time, they should wait for enough data
from the client to fill a complete packet, without any timeout. As well
as rendering the push function obsolete, explicit message boundaries
also make Nagle's algorithm unnecessary. The push function can, however,
be repurposed: explicit pushes can be applied to indicate that a message
should be delivered as quickly as possible (the push should be signalled
in the same send that delivers the end-of-message indication). The TCP
modules should then do everything they can to deliver the message
quickly, and should indicate to the user that the message was pushed. 
Both these interactions with the user can be mediated by a MSG_PUSH flag
in the send() or recvmsg() flags (and perhaps a MSG_PUSH_PENDING flag in
recvmsg(), to indicate that a message somewhere ahead is being pushed).
The push would be communicated in the TCP packets by the setting of the
PSH flag, as now. We might even enable out-of-order delivery of the
pushed message, but that would be very weird. In essence, we're swapping
the semantics of the push and urgent functions!</p>
