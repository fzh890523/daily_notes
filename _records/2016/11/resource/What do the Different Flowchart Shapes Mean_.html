<td height="345">This shape tells you where the flowchart begins and ends. It
  shows the entry point of your flowchart and the exit point. To designate the
  start of your flowchart, you would fill this shape with words like <b>Start</b>
  or <b>Begin</b>. The words you use are up to you.

<td height="303">You read a flowchart by following the lines with arrows from
  shape to shape. The lines with arrows determine the flow through the chart.
  Flowcharts are usually drawn from top to bottom or left to right. Numbering
  shapes is optional. Numbering is helpful if you have to refer to a shape in a
  discussion. In RFFlow you can turn on numbering by clicking on <b>Tools</b>
  and <b>Number Shapes</b>. Numbering does not determine the flow of control.
  That is determined by the lines with arrows.&nbsp;
  <p><img border="0" src="./What do the Different Flowchart Shapes Mean__files/fcs_line.png" width="187" height="53"></p>
  <p>If two lines cross, you ignore the perpendicular line and continue
  following the line to the next shape. If there may be confusion as to the
  path, you can insert a bridge or
  crossover, which is a little bump on crossed lines. In RFFlow, you can insert bridges on crossed lines by clicking on <b>Tools</b>,
  <b>Global Changes</b>, and <b>Add Crossovers</b>.

<td height="139">In most flowcharts, the rectangle is the most common shape. It
  is used to show a process, task, action, or operation. It shows something that
  has to be done or an action that has to be taken.&nbsp;The text in the
  rectangle almost always includes a verb.

<td height="471">A decision asks a question. The answer to the question
  determines which arrow you follow out of the decision shape. For example, in
  the shape below, if it is cloudy, you follow the arrow down
  near the word <b>Yes</b>. If it is not cloudy, you follow the arrow to the
  right near the word <b>No</b>.&nbsp;
  <p><img border="0" src="./What do the Different Flowchart Shapes Mean__files/fcs_cloudy.png" width="254" height="254"></p>
  <p>The arrows flowing from the decision shape are usually labeled with <b>Yes</b>,
  <b>No</b> or <b>True</b>, <b>False</b>. But you can label them any way you
  want as long as the meaning is clear. This shape has one input arrow. It is
  usually at the top, but can be on any corner. The decision shape can have two
  or three exit points. If you need more than 3 exit points, then you can use
  either of the methods shown below.

<td height="120">
If you need to connect to another page or another section of the chart, and
can't draw a line, you can use a circle. You draw the line to the circle and
label the circle with a letter. Then you place a copy of the circle where you
want the flow to continue. This should be avoided, but sometimes is necessary.
Originally the circle was used only to reference another part of the chart and
the off page connector, shown later, was used to go to another page. However,
the circle is now often used for both.
<p><img border="0" src="./What do the Different Flowchart Shapes Mean__files/fcs_circles.png" width="280" height="70">
</p><p>In Process Mapping the circle represents an Inspection. At an inspection, the
quality of the product is evaluated. The flow continues only if the product is
approved.

<font size="4">For most flowcharting you need only use the basic flowchart shapes listed above.
Those listed below are included to be complete, but you don't have to use them.</font>
</p><p>If you are working in a group, you should decide which
flowcharting shapes should be used and form your own standards. There are no
universal standards in flowcharting. There have been ISO standards written, like
ISO 5807 and DIN 66001, but they were largely ignored. DIN 66001 seems to be
popular in Germany. It is important that people reading a
flowchart understand the information it is trying to convey. Using more than the
basic shapes often confuses people and adds nothing to the overall goal of your
project. Flowcharts can be helpful in understanding a process. The goal should
be understanding and improving the process and not be just generating
flowcharts.

This is the old IBM punched card. Each line of a program was punched into one

Usually the student would submit the cards and someone else would run them

printed on wide z-fold paper. If you made a mistake, you would have to resubmit
the cards and wait another day. Large programs had stacks of cards several feet
high. If you are using this shape, you need to update your hardware.

Punched tape is another antiquated technology. A software program would be saved
by noisily punching holes in a paper tape. The paper tape was about an inch wide
and hundreds of feet long. The holes were large enough to see. As the
minicomputer punched the tape, it would stream onto the floor. Then the
programmer would take a battery operated gadget that would wrap the tape into a
nice roll. The computer could read the tape from this roll to reload the
program. If you had a special program that you wanted to save, you would use a
Mylar polyester tape instead of paper, as it was stronger and lasted longer. (My
