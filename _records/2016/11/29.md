# golang里loop里声明变量的（每次）初始化

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var i int
    for i=0;i<20;i++{
        var k int
        if i % 5 == 0 {
            k = 10
        }
        fmt.Printf("k is %d while i is %d\n", k, i)
    }
}
```

```
k is 10 while i is 0
k is 0 while i is 1
k is 0 while i is 2
k is 0 while i is 3
k is 0 while i is 4
k is 10 while i is 5
k is 0 while i is 6
k is 0 while i is 7
k is 0 while i is 8
k is 0 while i is 9
k is 10 while i is 10
k is 0 while i is 11
k is 0 while i is 12
k is 0 while i is 13
k is 0 while i is 14
k is 10 while i is 15
k is 0 while i is 16
k is 0 while i is 17
k is 0 while i is 18
k is 0 while i is 19
```

可以看到， `var k int` 等同于 `var k int = 0`，也即每次loop都会init/assign一遍。

具体语义可以看看go spec。
