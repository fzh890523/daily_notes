> ref: [HBase-0.98.3 如何调整RPC连接的数量](http://www.cnblogs.com/wangqianbo/p/3811129.html)

listener -> [readers] -> **call queue** -> request handlers

## listener
数量为1
负责分配conn给reader

## readers量级为10
负责处理conn，read出数据封包为call丢到queue里

**call超时怎么处理？**

## request handlers量级为 512
从queue里取call进行处理...

## callQueue

### callQueue相关优化
> ref: [a couple of callQueue related improvements](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11355)
高并发情况下，阻塞在callQueue的性能开销较为明显，上文里提到了拆分callQueue、分为读写请求queue等优化方式，性能提升较为明显

[Chapter 14. Apache HBase Performance Tuning](http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/cdh/5/hbase-0.98.6-cdh5.3.5/book/perf.configurations.html)
这里提到了该优化已经使用。
主要涉及以下参数：
* `hbase.ipc.server.num.callqueue` 多callQueue
* `hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.read.ratio` 读写queue分离
* `hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.scan.ratio` 长短read queue分离（长read -> scan）
* `hbase.ipc.server.callqueue.handler.factor` 共享queue情况，0表示所有handler共享一个queue；1表示每个handler独享一个queue；0.5表示2个handler共享一个queue，以此类推
> 线上似乎配置了0.1，也即10个handler共享一个queue

# block size 对随机读（Get）和顺序读（Scan)的影响
> ref: [HBase最佳实践－列族设计优化](http://hbasefly.com/2016/07/02/hbase-pracise-cfsetting/)

简而言之就是：
* 随着BlockSize的增大，系统随机读的吞吐量不断降低，延迟不断增大。64K大小比16K大小的吞吐量大约降低13%，延迟增大13%。同样的，128K大小比64K大小的吞吐量降低约22%，延迟增大27%。因此，对于以随机读为主的业务，可以适当调低BlockSize的大小，以获得更好的读性能。
* 随着BlockSize增大，scan的吞吐量逐渐增大，延迟不断降低。64K大小BlockSize比16K大小的吞吐量增加了33%，延迟降低了24%；128K大小比64K大小吞吐量增加了7%，延迟降低了7%；因此，对于以scan为主的业务，可以适当增大BlockSize的大小，以获得更好的读性能。

> 可见，如果业务请求以Get请求为主，可以考虑将块大小设置较小；如果以Scan请求为主，可以将块大小调大；默认的64M块大小是在Scan和Get之间取得的一个平衡。 （#yonka# **勘误**： 应该为 64K块大小）

A simple way would be find out all the apps having the permission "draw over other apps" and then single out them from the ones currently active on the screen. Afterwards, engage in force-stopping those common apps until you pin-point the app responsible for the active overlay.

Note:

adb should already be setup in PC.
For Android earlier than version 4.4.x, root access may be required.
Jump to heading "Apps for apps" if you're unfamiliar or uncomfortable with command-line and/or the command-line fails to solve your issue.
Enumerate apps having permission for overlay

The permission required by an app to create an overlay is android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW (draw over other apps).

We need to find out all the installed apps having the said permission. It is up to you to find out a method for this. My answer here may aid you.

Note that we need the apps' package names and not their labels.

Cherry-pick from active windows

Execute the command

adb shell dumpsys window windows 
This would give you details on whatsoever causing something to be displayed on the screen, including the component name of an app causing it.

How you would extract the name is up to you. You may try this command however

adb shell 'dumpsys window windows | grep "Window #"'
Demo output

Window #4 Window{42065d50 u0 com.android.phone/com.mediatek.phone.UssdAlertActivity}:
Window #5 Window{42197468 u0 ginlemon.flowerpro/ginlemon.flower.HomeScreen}:
Window #6 Window{420fdb58 u0 com.android.systemui.ImageWallpaper}:
Window #7 Window{421e3b88 u0 com.android.contacts/com.android.contacts.activities.DialtactsActivity}:
In the above output, anything succeeding  u0  and preceding / is the package name of an app. An app can have multiple components displaying something on the screen.

You've to create a list of those package names. If you have BusyBox installed, you can do

adb shell 'dumpsys window windows | grep "Window #" | sed -e "s/.*u0 //g" -e "s/\/.*//g" -e "s/}://g"'
Anyhow, now you would be having two lists:

First list contains all the apps having the permission android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW.
Second list contains all the apps actively displaying something on the screen.
Compare these two lists and single out apps which are common in both the lists. This third list would constitute of apps having the permission to draw overlay and are currently drawing an active overlay on screen.

Time to kill

Kill each of the apps from the third list one by one and notice the state of overlay. You can use am force-stop PACKAGE_NAME --user 0 or any other method that suits you. PACKAGE_NAME is the package name of the app.

EDIT: It is not necessary to kill an app. You can consider denying the app the permission to draw over other apps. Use this command:

adb shell 'appops set PACKAGE SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW deny'   # replace PACKAGE with package name of the app
To revert the changes, replace deny with allow in the said command and execute it.

If you're running Android Marshmallow, this answer by Andrew T. can be used.

Note: The aforesaid command is successfully tested on Android 5.1.1 and 6.0.1 (CM builds). It is also possible that the command works on Android 5.0.x but I can't guarantee. Execution of that command on Android version released prior to Lollipop would cause failure.

Since often the overlay is perceivable, it would instantly disappear the moment the app causing it is killed, hence, you would know which app was causing that overlay.

Apps for apps

Originally suggested by Izzy, you can use an app which has the functionality of listing permissions granted to installed apps, to single out the apps having the permission "draw over other apps". You can either search such an app on your own or use the the list Permission checker maintained by Izzy on his website.

You would also need a process/app manager to force-stop/kill some processes. I recommend OS Monitor but you're at liberty to use any competent app. See related apps under System Info.

For demonstration purposes only

I tried Advanced Permission Manager to list apps with permission to "draw over other apps". Afterwards, I switched to OS Monitor to see the apps running in foreground and background. I matched the output from both the apps and individually force-stopped the apps common in both. You can kill a process from inside the OS Monitor, so no need to switch to App settings.
```

```shell
adb shell dumpsys window windows 
adb shell 'dumpsys window windows | grep "Window #"'
adb shell 'dumpsys window windows | grep "Window #" | sed -e "s/.*u0 //g" -e "s/\/.*//g" -e "s/}://g"'
adb shell 'appops set PACKAGE SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW deny'   # replace PACKAGE with package name of the app
```
