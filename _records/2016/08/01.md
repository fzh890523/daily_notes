## udp socket状态
`udp只有一个状态，listening or not，也即"having a socket open on it by a process" or "not having any socket open"`

## udp端口可用性
由于udp协议并不要求做ack，所以对其可用性的判断是个问题。

* 如果系统没有进程监听在该udp端口： `the system should respond with an ICMP Destination Unreachable packet with code=3 (Port unreachable)`。 但由于**很多防火墙都可能会拦截/丢弃该icmp包**，所以有可能无法收到该包。也即无法知道该udp端口是否在监听（打开）。 对于这一点，tcp也许类似（是不是会发RST？）。

## 延伸： 已有的udp ha方案

### nginx plus
```
If a server fails to respond to a request, NGINX marks it as ‘failed’ and temporarily stops sending datagrams to it. Every few seconds, NGINX checks the server’s health to see if it has recovered by sending it a small amount of live traffic.

NGINX Plus R9 will include application (also called ‘asynchronous’ or ‘synthetic’) health checks for UDP services, similar to those for HTTP and TCP traffic. You’ll be able to configure NGINX Plus to send special UDP requests to the upstream servers, and define the type of response the servers must return to be considered healthy.
```

似乎是约定 ping-request/ping-response 包

### 某Configuring TCP & UDP Health Checks
```
Configuring TCP & UDP Health Checks

Layer 4 TCP and UDP health checks are "liveness" checks. At Layer 4, Equalizer sends health check probes and attempts to connect to a specific TCP or UDP port. A TCP SYN request to port 80, for example, would expect a TCP SYN ACK response in return. If the response is not received within the configured timeouts and intervals, port 80 would be marked DOWN for that server, or server instance.

    
L4 UDP probes are performed on UDP protocol servers and are valid for IPv4 addresses only.
For specific Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services running on well-known ports - Network File System (NFS) and portmap - an RPC call is sent to the server. If no response is received the server is marked DOWN.

For the Domain Name System (DNS), a DNS request is sent to the server. If no response is received the server is marked DOWN.

For all other UDP services, a UDP datagram is sent to the server probe port and if no response is received the server is marked DOWN.

Layer 4 TCP and UDP health checks can be disabled either globally or by attached health check using either the CLI or the GUI. Refer to Disabling Health Checks for procedures.

When you configure a server pool with TCP server instances. The server pools will have one TCP-Default health check. (See System Health Checks).Likewise, when you configure a server pool using UDP server instances, a UDP-Default health check will be attached to the server instance.

UDP Probing Behavior
UDP probes are sent via ports 53, 111, and 2049. On all other ports, a “dummy” probe, which would not be recognizable to a receiving service, is also transmitted.

If a UDP response is received, the probe is considered UP.
If an ICMP "destination unreachable" response is received for either port or protocol, the probe is considered “DOWN”.
If no response is received, the UP/DOWN determination depends on the health check’s Relax (relaxed_probein the CLI ) option is enabled.
If the Relax (relaxed_probe) option is enabled, the probe is considered “UP”.
If the Relax (relaxed_probe) option is not enabled, the probe is considered “DOWN”.
In all cases, the state of a probe or the object to which it is attached will not change until one probe interval has passed since the probe began. This prevents spurious UP/DOWN indications and alerts.
UDP probing is only valid for IPv4 addresses.
```

1. 发送probe包，对于知名协议，发送对应的probe包，对于其他未知端口，发送“dummy”包避免被误处理（还是有些风险，知名协议端口还是可以跑别的服务）
2. 根据响应类型/方式分别判断
    1. 如果有响应，自然ok
    2. 如果收到icmp 3，nok
    3. 如果都没收到（UDP本身没有ACK，应用层协议又不一定都需要回应用层ACK/response），则根据配置的行为来决定认为UP还是DOWN
